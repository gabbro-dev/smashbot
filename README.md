This is my first finished Discord Bot: Smash Bros Argentina

This bot scans the data from the Argentina Smash Ranking website and saves the top 20 users into a Python Class. It has commands to watch information on-demand of any of the players in the class, searching by name and by top. It also has two other commands: One to update the players information (the class instances) and another to see the Smash latest Tierlist.
This bot was made using a webscrapper to gather the data from the ranking website, alongside regular expressions to filter that data from the HTML to then save it into the class. Then the commands just use that data to show the players Name, Top, Last 12 tournaments they participated in with their results, winrate and mains in a nice looking embed that changes its color and emojis depending on other information of the player.

This bot was made for training myself with simple python OOP, webscrappers and regular expressions.  Also, getting used to nextcord and its commands since this is my first Discord Bot (where i actually understand what im doing)
